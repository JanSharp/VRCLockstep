- [ ] more consistently send the client joined IA... though looking at it it's already pretty consistent. I don't know how it was possible for the client joined IA to just not get run on the master, as though it wasn't even received...
- [ ] maybe handle receiving tick sync data even when we are owner of the tick sync script
- [ ] there's apparently a way for the master client to have the client state "normal"... and it makes no sense... for now I've simply added a log message in the only location where it seems like it would be possible to happen, as well as having handled OnClientJoinedIA running late
- [ ] import/export ui needs a settings button for each game state, probably in the root/main list... maybe just in every list. That'll pop up a ui next to the main UI which has game state specific settings
- [ ] maybe add option for other systems to add per client info into the info ui
- [ ] make tick timing more consistent around master changes to improve RealtimeAtTick's usefulness
- [ ] add game state safe prng
- [ ] make a tool to automatically extract autosaves and neatly arrange them in a folder, like the user's documents folder
- [ ] on nth tick? game state safe.
- [ ] raise event delayed by ticks, game state safe.
- [ ] ensure that any functions that previously were guaranteed to only ever run on the master are now checking if the local client is still master
- [ ] reconsider adding local player id to the lockstep api. It's needed like all the time
- [ ] add LockstepAPI lockstep field to LockstepGameState directly
- [ ] add WriteFlags and ReadFlags with 8 overloads each, allowing to read and write up to 8 booleans
- [ ] handle null ExportUI and ImportUI, because it is valid for something to support import export but not have option UIs
- [ ] disable import/export buttons in game states UI until OnInit or OnClientBeginCatchUp is raised
- [ ] expose current import/export options on every game state throughout the entire duration of each game state being imported/exported
- [ ] use masking instead of truncate, I think that way when it does overflow you can still use the End button to get to the end of an input field, requires testing
- [ ] add autosaving to game states UI again
- [x] do not sort game states by them supporting import export in lockstep editor scripting
- [x] think about ValidateOptions again for import and probably also export
- [x] clear import UI and show info message about pasting exported data into the input field when opening the import UI
- [x] consecutive imports appear to make custom import options disappear, somehow
- [x] must not show import export option UIs before they're initialized - before OnInit or OnClientBeginCatchUp is raised
- [x] does the local player exist already in the client states game state at the time of OnClientBeginCatchUp being raised?
- [x] deduplicate UI updates in info UI now that latency preferences changes raise events
- [x] rate limit updating the master preference when using the slider
- [x] use the new CustomRaisedEvent attribute system for lockstep events
