# Lockstep

Lockstep networking (at least similar) infrastructure for UdonSharp.

# Installing

(It's not actually published as a package yet, but once it is the following applies.)

Depends on [CyanPlayerObjectPool](https://cyanlaser.github.io/CyanPlayerObjectPool/), so make sure to add this listing too.

Head to my [VCC Listing](https://jansharp.github.io/vrc/vcclisting.xhtml) and follow the instructions there.

# Overview for World Creators

The majority of what Lockstep is and its documentation does not matter to world creators. However a few things are quite relevant and are outlined [here](Documentation~/overview.md).

# Documentation

Online: [On github](https://github.com/JanSharp/VRCLockstep/blob/main/Documentation~/index.md).

Offline: In the `Documentation~` folder, as the [Unity's Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/cus-document.html) suggests. Probably the easiest way to do it how Unity wants you to do it is by right clicking the package in the Project window (the Packages list is collapsed by default), wait for the packages panel to finish loading, and then press the Documentation button there.
